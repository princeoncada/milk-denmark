                Every MILK™ babygrow tells the story of childhood fashion, but with sketches in the place of words. Inspired by afternoon walks through autumn and spring, each flower bud is a tickle of nature in the form of a sweet silhouette. The soft textures swaddle more than baby’s skin, but envelope families in the patterns of fairytale fashions. Designed with heart, inspired in Denmark.
