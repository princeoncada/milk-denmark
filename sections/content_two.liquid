                Every MILKâ„¢ babygrow tells the story of childhood fashion, but with sketches in the place of words.
                Inspired by afternoon walks through autumn and spring, each flower bud is a tickle of nature in the form
                of a sweet silhouette. The soft textures swaddle more than baby&apos;s skin, but envelope families in the
                patterns of fairytale fashions. Designed with heart, inspired in Denmark.
